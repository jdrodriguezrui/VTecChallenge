Technical test for interview process
## Solutions to the problem
* A simple solution to the problem would be avoid waiting time. People could be given detailed information about the exact time their bus would arrive. This way, waiting would be reduced and people would have more information to plan their trips.
* Another posible solution would be to offer alternate transportation methods. Instead of bus, one could share car with another person that has a similar destination to ours. In case it existed, a last mile in our trip could be traversed by foot or using another short-distance vehicle, like a scooter.
